				Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. 
				Angular is written in TypeScript. 
				It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.
			</p>
			
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Angular took a lot of the community by storm when it was first released in 2010.</li>
				<li>Fast forward to 2016, and the core team at Google delivered the successor to AngularJS… Angular2. Or, “Just Angular”.</li>
				<li>Prior to its release, a Google employee by the name of Miško Hevery, was developing a side project.</li>
				<li>Misko and a few others started to create a few more internal applications with AngularJS, eventually releasing it as an open source project in 2010.</li>
				<li>Several years after its initial release, the landscape of web development started to change and AngularJS hit a wall.</li>
				<li>However, it was never intended or designed for these situations when Miško first created it.</li>
				<li>With every pull request we modified AngularJS the best we could to fit our needs.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<!--<ul>
				<li>This however showed weasel</li>
				<li>Well uncritical so misled</li>
				<li>Goodness much until that fluid owl</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p data-new-link="true">When she reached the first hills of the 
				<strong>Italic Mountains</strong>, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown <em>Bookmarksgrove</em>, the headline of 
				<a href="http://google.com/">Alphabet Village</a> and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued 
				her way. On her way she met a copy.

			<h3>Overview & features</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. </li>
				<li>Directives are the most challenging Angular features. You can create custom HTML tags serving as custom widgets with the help of directives.</li>
				<li>It combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. In this post, you will get brief information of angular version history.</li>
				<li>If you have developed functionality that is suitable for reuse, you can create your own libraries. </li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					The loading time of Angular apps is faster than any other front end framework in the industry.&nbsp;
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>With angular you can develop progressive web application (PWA).</li>
				<li>Angular have efficient two way binding.</li>
				<li>Angular is a low code framework comparing to the other front end technology.</li>
				<li>With TypeScript, Angular offers a seamless experience to the developers. And TypeScript is the top choice for frontend development in 2019.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
				<!--But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long 
until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with 
		<a href="http://google.com/">Longe and Parole</a> and dragged her into their agency, where they 
abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

			<h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0o-4yc2n-8">How it works?</a></h3>
			
			
			
			
			<h3> Why should you learn Asp.net? </h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>It defines numerous ways to organize web application at client side.</li>
				<li>Enhance HTML by attaching directives, custom tags, attributes, expressions, templates within HTML.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					Good for single page Application. 
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>Encourage TDD.</li>
				<li>Encourage MVC design pattern.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			
			<h3>When to use Angular?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>When you are developing a progressive web application.</li>
				<li>When you are creating a large enterprise website or another large scale project that involves a complex infrastructure.</li>
				<li>When you are developing website that rely on dynamic content.</li>
				<li>When you would like to upgrade outdated website application design.</li>
				<li>When you have hired to improve the user experience for a large website by initiating a major redesign.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3> Benefits of Angular</h3>
			<ol font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Two way data binding</h6>
					<p>
						Two-way binding ensure any changes in the view get reflected in the application and vice versa.
						The underlying complexity is handled by the ngModule directive in angular and using these users can achieve this reflection of data and view in their applications. 
						It comes from a data binding technique to link your data to your view.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Faster server performance</h6>
					<p>
						Angular as a framework comes loaded with a ton of CPU performance-enhancing features and since everything is written in a type-safe manner via typescript the inherent framework in much faster than other native js ones.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Super ease of testing frontend angular applications</h6>
					<p>
						Since the angular architecture is built around dependency injection style of architecture, it really helps in doing test-driven document.
						 It also allows components to be mocked and isolated, leading to better writing of unit test cases and integration test cases for an application.

					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Readability</h6>
					<p>
						Encapsulation also ensures that new developers – who’ve been recently on boarded to a project – can read code better and eventually reach their plateau of productivity faster. 
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Reusability</h6>
					<p>
						Similar components are greatly encapsulated, or we can say self-sufficient. Developers can reuse them on different parts of an app. 
						This is particularly beneficial in enterprise-scope apps where diverse systems come together.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<h3>Drawbacks of Angular </h3>
			<ol font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Compulsory java script support</h6>
					<p>
						Suppose your computers have access to your server but the support for JavaScript is disabled. 
						In such cases, the associated users won’t be able to access your website or apps. If there are many users like this, you can expect your Angular-based websites to be less fruitful. 
						This, however, is not the case with webs that are plain HTML-based.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Steep learning curve</h6>
					<p>
						Angular is a versatile instrument, there is always more than one way to complete any task. 
						This can create confusion among developers. 
						There many tutorials and discussions, however, that can resolve most of the problems.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Scopes</h6>
					<p>
						Layered and organized hierarchically, scopes can be complex to handle if you have no prior experience with Angular. 
						One of the most difficult things to do could be debugging the scopes.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Performance tradeoff</h6>
					<p>
						Due to two-way data binding especially on old devices, angular dom-manipulation can also lead to a performance tradeoff since the browser will be super busy manipulating the dom elements and will take a lot of the computer resources.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Heavy weighted framework</h6>
					<p>
						A lot of competition from other lightweight and different architectures like React and Vue also acts as a con for angular which is a pretty bloated and heavy framework.
					</p>
				</li>
				
			</ol>
			
			
			
			<h3> Differences </h3>

			<h3>When to use Asp.net? </h3>
			<ul font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Scalable Products</h6>
					<p>
						Usually, business needs are growing and your software has to scale with it. 
						.NET provides a scalable environment and allows for redesigning ongoing applications in order to match the growing needs of the business.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Cross Platform needs</h6>
					<p>
						In case you need the app that will work across platforms, .NET will be a great choice as most platforms are covered and you can reduce development effort while expanding your desktop or mobile app to other operating systems. 
						Also, .NET can be used for such specific engineering cases as gaming (including Xbox).plify your work.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Enterprise scale infrastructure</h6>
					<p>
						It’s still a debatable point whether .NET is designed mostly for enterprise use. 
						But Microsoft makes sure it provides the widest toolset possible to build and cross-integrate enterprise products, both internal and public ones.
					</p>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>How does Angular differ from other programming language?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>One of the main reason to use Angular is that it is supported by google.</li>
				<li>If we use Angular than we don’t need any additional getter or setter functions.</li>
				<li>Decoupled components are replaceable with better implementations. Simply put, it enables efficient code maintenance and update.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					In Angular, testing is extremely simple as compared to other languages or framework.
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>The component-based structure of Angular makes the components highly reusable across the app.</li>
				<li>Being independent of each other, the components make unit testing much easier.</li>
				<li>Consistency in coding makes reading the code a piece of cake for new developers on an ongoing project, which adds to their productivity.</li>
			</ul>
