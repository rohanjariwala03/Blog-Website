				Go is a general purpose programming language with advanced features and a clean syntax. 
				Because of its wide availability on a variety of platforms, its robust well-documented common library, and its focus on good software engineering principles, Go is an ideal language to learn as your first programming language.
			</p>
			
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Go is statically typed, compiled programming language which was designed at Google in 2007 and it was publically announced in November 2009.</li>
				<li>The Go design was primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++ language.</li>
				<li>After some years in March 2012 its version 1.0 was released. And after that they released many version in some years.</li>
				<li>The latest version of Go is 1.14 which was released on 25th of February 2020.</li>
				<li>The main developers of Go language is Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<!--<ul>
				<li>This however showed weasel</li>
				<li>Well uncritical so misled</li>
				<li>Goodness much until that fluid owl</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p data-new-link="true">When she reached the first hills of the 
				<strong>Italic Mountains</strong>, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown <em>Bookmarksgrove</em>, the headline of 
				<a href="http://google.com/">Alphabet Village</a> and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued 
				her way. On her way she met a copy.
			</p>
			-->
			
			<h3>Overview & features</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Go have the same syntax as we uses in C Language.</li>
				<li>Go language readability and usability is same as the Python and JavaScript.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					This language mainly developed to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, network machines and large codebases.
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>But Go have some extra features such as memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing and concurrency.</li>
				<li>The language is mainly known as “Golang” due to his domain name, golang.org but its proper name is GO.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
				<!--But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long 
until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with 
		<a href="http://google.com/">Longe and Parole</a> and dragged her into their agency, where they 
abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.
			</p>
			-->
			
			
			
			<h3>Printing text & data in Go</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Go language is same as C language there is minor changes in printing a statement.</li>
				<li>Whenever we want to print statement in Golang we have to write “import fmt”.</li>
				<li>Fmt is a package which implements formatted input or output with functions.</li>
				<li>And after importing the package we have to write same statement as we write in C language but before write Println we have to just add “fmt.”.</li>
				<li>Example:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>fmt.Println(“Hello World”);</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					If you want to print user define value then you have to use several keywords. Such as,<br>
					<figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="60" class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-max-height="33.75">
					<div>
						<img src="../img/Go_Print.png" alt="">
					</div>
					<figcaption>Ex: fmt.Println(“%s”, VariableName);</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			
			<h3>Taking input in Go</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Scanln is used in Golang to take input from user.</li>
				<li>Example: <br>
					<ul><li>Fmt.Scanln(&VariableName); </li></ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
				
			
			<h3>Comments</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>To give single line comments we have to use “//”.</li>
				<li>Where as to give multiline comment we have to use “/*” to start the comment section and “*/” to end the comment section.</li>
				<li>The syntax is same as the most of the other programming languages.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3> Benefits of Go</h3>
			<ol font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Ease of use</h6>
					<p>
						Go is easy to understand. 
						The syntax is clean and accessible to newcomers and there aren’t any complex structure to learn. 
						The close similarity to C language, it will be really easy to learn for C++ or C# proficient.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Smart Standard Library</h6>
					<p>
						Go users can accomplish a lot without having to import or learn complicated secondary libraries. 
						The standard library that comes packaged with Go is sophisticated without overwhelming, and it reduces the risk of errors from conflicting function names.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Strong Security Built-in</h6>
					<p>
						In Go there is a built in garbage collector which helps to prevent memory from bleeding off in your code.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<h3>Drawbacks of Go </h3>
			<ol font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Too Simplistic</h6>
					<p>
						One of the Go main advantage is also one of the biggest weakness. 
						Go may be an easy language to pick up, but that brings with lack of versatility.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Lack of Virtual Machine</h6>
					<p>
						Most of the languages are now based on virtual machines so they are more efficient but Go is not based VMS which is Weakness of it.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Still Young Language</h6>
					<p>
						There is a lot of promise by Go, but it’s a language which still in process that means it can’t compete with similar languages. Go native library may be designed smartly and efficiently, but it competing with languages like Java that comes supported by huge collection of code.
					</p>
				</li>
				
			</ol>

			<h3>How does Golang differ from other programming language?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do away with the needs of working with different subsets of language for one project.</li>
				<li>A boost to code readability and documentation.</li>
				<li>Offering a thoroughly consistent language.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					Fast compilation and execution.
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>Easy versioning of program.</li>
				<li>Allowing developing with multiple languages.</li>
				<li>Allowing easier maintenance of dependencies. </li>
			</ul>
