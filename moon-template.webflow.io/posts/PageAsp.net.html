				Asp.net is an open source, server side application framework.
				ASP.NET is a web development platform, which provides a programming model, a comprehensive software infrastructure and various services required to build up robust web applications for PC, as well as mobile devices.
				It is a part of Microsoft .Net platform.
			</p>
			
			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Asp.net evolved from traditional ASP.</li>
				<li>Asp stands for Active Server Pages.</li>
				<li>It was developed by Microsoft.</li>
				<li>Then Microsoft enhanced this web technology and embedded in its revolutionary .net framework.</li>
				<li>Initially, two beta version of Asp.net released in 2000 and 2001.</li>
				<li>The first version of its framework was first released on 5th January 2002.</li>
				<li>ASP.NET’s successor is ASP.NET core.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<!--<ul>
				<li>This however showed weasel</li>
				<li>Well uncritical so misled</li>
				<li>Goodness much until that fluid owl</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p data-new-link="true">When she reached the first hills of the 
				<strong>Italic Mountains</strong>, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown <em>Bookmarksgrove</em>, the headline of 
				<a href="http://google.com/">Alphabet Village</a> and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued 
				her way. On her way she met a copy.
			</p>
			-->
			
			<h3>Overview & features</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>Asp.net also allows developers to use languages like Visual C#, Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Visual F# to make websites.</li>
				
				<li>It expands the .NET platform by having a base framework for processing web requests in C# or F# and with libraries for common web patterns, like the Model View Controller.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					Asp.NET is a Microsoft scripting language created with the purpose of adding to the .NET platform with tools and libraries specifically for building web apps and enabling developers to create interactive websites.&nbsp;
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>Asp.net is built on the common language runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write Asp.net code using any supporter.</li>
				<li>It has editor extensions to code completion, syntax highlighting, and other functionality specifically for developing web pages.</li>
				<li>Additionally, the authentication system included libraries, databases, and template pages for handling logins, including multi-factor authentication and external authentication. ASP.NET has another advantage in being cross-platform so it runs on macOS, Windows, Linux, and Docker.</li>
				<li>Extension of Asp.net website is “.aspx”.
				</ul>
			</p>
				<!--But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long 
until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with 
		<a href="http://google.com/">Longe and Parole</a> and dragged her into their agency, where they 
abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.

			<h3>How it works?</h3>
			<figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="60" class="w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-max-height="33.75">

					<img src="../img/Asp_Arch1.png" alt="">
				</div>
			<figcaption>How it works?</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			
			<h3> Why should you learn Asp.net? </h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
				<li>High speed, low cost, and vast language support are among the most significant benefits.</li>
				<li>The popularity of ASP.NET makes online resources and skilled developers easy to find.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					ASP.NET is built into the familiar Windows server environment, requiring less setup and configuration than other web development platforms that must be installed and configured separately. 
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>Websites and applications built with ASP.NET can be faster and more efficient than a website build with PHP. </li>
				<li>For example. ASP.NET applications are compiled, which means the code is translated into object code, which is then executed. </li>
				<li>This compilation process takes a small amount of time, but happens only once. After compilation, the code can be executed over and over by the .Net platform very quickly.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3> Benefits of Asp.net</h3>
			<ol font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Object Oriented Software model</h6>
					<p>
						Asp.net is based on object oriented programming. 
						OOP is a development model for breaking down software into smaller pieces that are easier to manage and combine.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Reliable and simple caching system</h6>
					<p>
						Caching means keeping data in a temporary storage place to call it faster when needed.
						The stored data is the result of an earlier information request.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Storage customization option</h6>
					<p>
						Customization of storage used to be problematic with older frameworks. 
						The problem was, they were too cramped. 
						Now, separating identity information storage from the security implementation code is not a problem anymore, data storage is a lot more streamlined.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Speed</h6>
					<p>
						The environment and the programming language host benefits that gives developers the ability to lay down the basics quickly and create a website fast. 
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Asynchronous support</h6>
					<p>
						The vast majority of the APIs in the framework are asynchronous and this can be seen as an advantage. 
						This is something that isn’t only a clear advantage now, but also in the days to come.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			
			<h3>Drawbacks of Asp.net </h3>
			<ol font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Windows</h6>
					<p>
						Some developers dislike the fact that the ASP.NET framework tends to follow the Windows form. 
						Their main grudge is that the form is way too similar and that can end up in a few awkward moments in the development process of web-based applications.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Licensing cost</h6>
					<p>
						Building .NET apps isn’t cheap regardless of open source technologies. 
						Mostly, your expenses will be spent on Visual Studio IDE and other additional collaboration and quality assurance services that Microsoft offers to simplify your work.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Poor security features</h6>
					<p>
						ASP.NET was known for lacking some of the basic security features that other frameworks offered out of the box. 
						Email account verification, username reminder, mobile verification, password reset, and modern password storage were lacking.
					</p>
				</li>
				
			</ol>

			<h3>When to use Asp.net? </h3>
			<ul font-weight="bold">
				
				<li>
					<h6>Scalable Products</h6>
					<p>
						Usually, business needs are growing and your software has to scale with it. 
						.NET provides a scalable environment and allows for redesigning ongoing applications in order to match the growing needs of the business.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Cross Platform needs</h6>
					<p>
						In case you need the app that will work across platforms, .NET will be a great choice as most platforms are covered and you can reduce development effort while expanding your desktop or mobile app to other operating systems. 
						Also, .NET can be used for such specific engineering cases as gaming (including Xbox).plify your work.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h6>Enterprise scale infrastructure</h6>
					<p>
						It’s still a debatable point whether .NET is designed mostly for enterprise use. 
						But Microsoft makes sure it provides the widest toolset possible to build and cross-integrate enterprise products, both internal and public ones.
					</p>
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3>How does Asp.net differ from other programming language?</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Aside from that, the Microsoft eco system is superb tooling such as Microsoft studio is very complete IDE.</li>
				<li>Integration with other components is excellent, from desktop server to Azure cloud services, the platform is very consistent.</li>
				<li>Moreover, with Asp.net core, it is much simpler to create and maintain cross platform web application.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>
					Asp.net is a platform rather than a language. And it support languages such as C#, Vb.net and other languages.
				</blockquote>
				<ul>
				<li>It’s also fast as compare to other languages.</li>
				<li>Asp.net also have LINQ which provides extensive data querying and projection, this can be incredibly powerful and useful once you get the hang of it.</li>
				<li>Also, Asp.net has expanded well beyond a windows-only environment and can be used across virtually any operating system. </li>
			</ul>
